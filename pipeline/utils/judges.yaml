        indicators:
          - "Contains direct, undeniable self-contradictions within the response."
          - "Exhibits major logical fallacies that invalidate the argument (e.g., non-sequitur, ad hominem in reasoning context, appeal to emotion)."
          - "Demonstrates circular reasoning, where the conclusion is merely a restatement of a premise."
          - "Presents non-sequiturs, where claims or conclusions do not logically follow from prior statements."
          - "Arrives at conclusions that are completely invalid or unsupported by the provided premises or evidence."
      - range: [1.0, 1.9]
        label: "SUBSTANTIALLY INCONSISTENT (Significant Reasoning Gaps)"
        indicators:
          - "Contains indirect contradictions that become apparent upon deeper analysis."
          - "Features weak logical connections between ideas, making the argument difficult to follow or accept."
          - "Missing crucial logical steps or premises, requiring significant inference from the user."
          - "Exhibits unclear or poorly explained causality, making it hard to understand relationships between events/ideas."
          - "Contains significant reasoning gaps that undermine the overall coherence or persuasiveness."
      - range: [2.0, 2.9]
        label: "PARTIALLY CONSISTENT (Minor Flaws, Lacks Rigor)"
        indicators:
          - "Contains minor logical gaps or omissions that, while not critical, weaken the argument's strength."
          - "Includes some unclear connections that require the user to work to understand the flow."
          - "Relies on implicit assumptions that are not clearly stated or justified."
          - "Presents incomplete arguments that could be stronger with further elaboration or evidence."
          - "Exhibits mild or occasional inconsistencies that do not invalidate the entire response but detract from its polish."
      - range: [3.0, 3.9]
        label: "LOGICALLY SOUND (Meets Consistency Standards)"
        indicators:
          - "Presents a clear and easy-to-follow reasoning chain."
          - "Arguments are generally valid, with conclusions logically derived from premises."
          - "Exhibits good logical flow, with ideas connecting smoothly."
          - "Contains only minor, non-detrimental imperfections in reasoning."
          - "Arrives at solid, well-supported conclusions."
      - range: [4.0, 4.0]
        label: "PERFECTLY CONSISTENT (Exemplary Reasoning)"
        indicators:
          - "Possesses a flawless and robust logical structure throughout the response."
          - "Features a complete and explicit argument chain, where every step is clear and justified."
          - "Clearly articulates all premises, inferences, and conclusions."
          - "Demonstrates perfect internal coherence, with no contradictions or ambiguities."
          - "All reasoning is demonstrably valid and sound, demonstrating expert-level logical thought."
    guidelines:
      - "Use one decimal place precision (e.g., 2.5, 3.8)."
      - "Any direct contradiction or the presence of a major, argument-invalidating logical fallacy caps the score at 0.9."
      - "Check both explicitly stated logical connections and any implicit reasoning inferred from the text."
      - "Evaluate the completeness of the argument's reasoning, ensuring all necessary steps are present."
      - "Consider the clarity and explicitness of logical connections for ease of user comprehension."
